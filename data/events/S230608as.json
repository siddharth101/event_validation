But both detectors lost lock minutes later due to big earthquake (maybe Rat Island, 4.6 Mag, 2023-06-08 20:34:54 UTC). Still, both omegascans look pretty clean; signal is evident by eye, vaguely chirplike, and coincident in t-f, coherence lnB ~ 5.0. omega_overlap failed for H1. GSpyNetTree reports Fast_Scattering 100% for both detectors, but I don't see anything in the omegascans.
