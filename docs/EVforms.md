# EVforms

EVforms is a website that automates the process of communicating DetChar event validation results between different groups. To do that, the website contains forms that event validation volunteers and noise mitigation team should fill out. 

The website can be found [here](https://dqr.ligo.caltech.edu/ev_forms).
