# DetChar RRT

DetChar Rapid Response Team (RRT) experts (also known as level 1 DetChar RRT experts) are responsible for vetting candidate events found in low latency.
In O4, we will use a weekly rota where a DetChar RRT expert is responsible for attending RRT calls and providing feedback about the event DetChar status.


## Training

To become a DetChar RRT expert, one should have experience in:

- Data quality shifts
- Event validation shifts
- Shadowing RRT calls

For more information, see the training slides and recording [LIGO-G2300983](https://dcc.ligo.org/G2300983). If you are interested in becoming a DetChar RRT expert, please contact event validation leads Ronaldas ([ronaldas.macas@ligo.org](mailto:ronaldas.macas@ligo.org)) and Sidd ([siddharth.soni@ligo.org](mailto:siddharth.soni@ligo.org)).
