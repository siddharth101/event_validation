# O4a event validation

O4a starts on May 24, 2023 4pm UTC. All volunteers should have completed the training, see [the training page](training.md) for more details.

## Rota

The weekly event validation rota will consist of two volunteers and one DetChar expert. These two volunteers will be assigned 12-hour shifts for each day, i.e. they will be responsible for validating events that happened during their 12-hour shift for one week.

Currently we split the shifts at 4pm UTC time.
