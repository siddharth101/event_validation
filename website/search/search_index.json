When looking for any excess noise, make sure you look at least +2s after the merger time. Use omegascan , omega_overlap or glitchfind tasks. As to how far back you should look from the merger time, that depends on the signal type. Use omega_overlap or glitchfind task to see the time-frequency track of the signal. BBH signals are usually short, so it is enough to look at the omegascans from omega_overlap and glitchfind tasks that plot data up to 16s before the merger time. For BNS and NSBH signals, you may need to manually produce omegascans. For more recommendations, see the training recording and slides: LIGO-G2300839 .
