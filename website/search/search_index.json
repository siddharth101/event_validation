Guidelines on how to fill an event validation form Validation conclusion : Not observing \u2014 if the detector is not observing No DQ issues \u2014 if there are no data quality (DQ) issues, i.e. the noise boxes are empty DQ issues \u2014 if there are DQ issues present in any of the interferometer, i.e. any of the noise boxes are filled Detector is in low noise : this can be checked from the summary pages (e.g. link ) in the Lock Segments plot. Noise box start GPS time : If there are glitches present in the longest OmegaScan plot from DQR, note the gpstime of the first occurrence of a glitch Noise box end GPS time : If there are glitches present in the longest OmegaScan plot from DQR, note the gpstime of the last occurrence of a glitch Noise box f_low : If there are glitches present in the longest OmegaScan plot from DQR, note the starting frequency of a glitch Noise box f_high : If there are glitches present in the longest OmegaScan plot from DQR, note the highest frequency of a glitch Other recommendations : Put your summarizing notes in the \"Notes\" field Post your more extensive notes from GraceDB, Detector summary pages and the data quality report to the GitLab issue Note any DQR task failures or any other issues -- this is useful feedback which helps to improve the DQR! If a DQR task fails, it does not necessarily mean that there are DQ issues. Use your own judgement! If in doubt, contact a DetChar expert of the week. When looking for any excess noise, make sure you look at least +2s after the merger time. Use omegascan , omega_overlap or glitchfind tasks. As to how far back you should look from the merger time, that depends on the signal type. Use omega_overlap or glitchfind task to see the time-frequency track of the signal. BBH signals are usually short, so it is enough to look at the omegascans from omega_overlap and glitchfind tasks that plot data up to 16s before the merger time. For BNS and NSBH signals, you may need to manually produce omegascans. Please complete the even validation within one week after your shift ends. After the validation is completed, report your findings at a DetChar call. For more recommendations, see the training recording and slides: LIGO-G2300839 .
