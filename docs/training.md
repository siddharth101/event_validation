# Training

To be eligible for O4 DetChar event validation, a volunteer should:

- View the training recording and slides [links to be added after the training session]
- Validate events with an experienced validator (or having participated in the ER15 event validation training rota)

## ER15

We will use ER15 to train event validation volunteers. We highly recommend signing up for ER15 event validation if you have not done so. To do that, see [the ER15 page](ER15.md) for more information.

We also did the event validation training before ER15, see the slides and the recording [here](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G2300839). We plan to re-do the training before O4 starts with the event validation infrastructure finalized and real events from ER15. We will share the recording after the training.
