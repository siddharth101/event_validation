# O4 DetChar Event Validation 

This is the main page for O4 DetChar event validation. The webpage is still in progress but we plan to finalize its content within the next several weeks.

We are currently signing-up people for the ER15 event validation rota, see [the ER15 page](ER15.md) for more information.

You can find slides and the recording for the O4 DetChar event validation training on DCC: [LIGO-G2300839](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G2300839)
